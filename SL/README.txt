I created a program named sl that sorts the output of the ls -ai <DIRECTORY> command by inode numbers, displaying all files and their inode numbers. The program is invoked with the command ./sl <DIRECTORY>. First, it validates the command-line argument to ensure it is a readable directory, printing an error message if it is not. The main task involves creating two child processes: one executes ls -ai <DIRECTORY> and sends its output to the other, which executes the sort command. Pipes are used to connect the stdout of ls to the stdin of sort, and a second pipe connects the stdout of sort to the parent process, which reads and prints the total number of files. The program handles various error scenarios, ensuring robust operation by checking return codes and printing error messages if necessary.
